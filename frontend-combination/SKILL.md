# Frontend Combination — Unified Design & Development Skill

A self-contained super skill that combines 28 frontend/design skills into a single unified workflow with searchable CSV data, Python BM25 scripts, consolidated reference docs, and specialized satellite operations.

## Prerequisites

**Python 3.6+** is required for the search engine and design system generator.

```bash
python3 --version
```

If Python is not available, you can still use this skill — consult the reference docs in `reference/` directly instead of running scripts.

---

## Context Gathering Protocol

Design skills produce generic output without project context. Before any design work:

1. **Check current instructions**: If loaded instructions contain a **Design Context** section, proceed.
2. **Check .impeccable.md**: Read `.impeccable.md` from project root. If it has target audience, use cases, and brand personality, proceed.
3. **Run teach-impeccable**: If neither source has context, run `/teach-impeccable` first.

**Required context** (every design task needs):
- **Target audience**: Who uses this product and in what context?
- **Use cases**: What jobs are they trying to get done?
- **Brand personality/tone**: How should the interface feel?

**CRITICAL**: You cannot infer this context from code. Code tells you what was built, not who it's for or what it should feel like.

---

## Unified Workflow

This skill operates in 4 modes. Choose based on what you're doing:

### Mode 1: Design — Generate Design Systems & Search Styles

Generate a complete design system recommendation or search specific domains.

**Generate design system:**
```bash
python3 scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system [-p "Project Name"] [-f markdown]
```

**Search specific domains:**
```bash
python3 scripts/search.py "<query>" [--domain <domain>] [--max-results 5]
```

**Search stack-specific guidelines:**
```bash
python3 scripts/search.py "<query>" --stack <stack>
```

**Persist design system to files:**
```bash
python3 scripts/search.py "<query>" --design-system --persist [-p "Project Name"] [--page "dashboard"]
```

#### Search Domains

| Domain | CSV File | What It Covers |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| `style` | styles.csv | UI styles, CSS implementation, design system variables |
| `color` | colors.csv | Color palettes by product type |
| `chart` | charts.csv | Chart types, accessibility, libraries |
| `landing` | landing.csv | Landing page patterns, conversion optimization |
| `product` | products.csv | Product-type style recommendations |
| `ux` | ux-guidelines.csv | UX guidelines, do/don't with code examples |
| `typography` | typography.csv | Font pairings, Google Fonts URLs, CSS imports |
| `icons` | icons.csv | Icon libraries, import code, usage |
| `react` | react-performance.csv | React/Next.js performance rules |
| `web` | web-interface.csv | Web interface accessibility rules |
| `design-patterns` | design-patterns.csv | Design anti-patterns, AI slop tells, do/don't rules |
| `operations` | satellite-operations.csv | Which satellite operation to use |

Auto-detection selects the best domain from the query. Override with `--domain`.

#### Available Stacks

`html-tailwind`, `react`, `nextjs`, `astro`, `vue`, `nuxtjs`, `nuxt-ui`, `svelte`, `swiftui`, `react-native`, `flutter`, `shadcn`, `jetpack-compose`

---

### Mode 2: Build — Implementation Guidelines

When implementing, consult these references based on your stack:

**React / Next.js projects:**
- Search: `python3 scripts/search.py "<query>" --domain react`
- Stack: `python3 scripts/search.py "<query>" --stack nextjs`
- Reference: [react-best-practices.md](reference/react-best-practices.md) — Vercel's optimization rules
- Reference: [view-transitions.md](reference/view-transitions.md) — React View Transition API

**Game / hot-path code:**
- Reference: [game-performance.md](reference/game-performance.md) — Zero-allocation patterns for per-frame code

**Any web project:**
- Reference: [web-guidelines.md](reference/web-guidelines.md) — Accessibility, forms, animation, performance checklists
- Reference: [design-principles.md](reference/design-principles.md) — Typography, color, spatial, motion, interaction, responsive, UX writing

**Design anti-pattern check:**
```bash
python3 scripts/search.py "<query>" --review
```

---

### Mode 3: Review — Audit & Critique

Review existing interfaces for quality, accessibility, and design issues.

**Find which review operation to use:**
```bash
python3 scripts/search.py "<describe the problem>" --operation
```

**Check design patterns:**
```bash
python3 scripts/search.py "<element or pattern>" --review
```

**Key review operations** (from satellite skills):

| Need | Operation | What It Does |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Full design critique | `/critique` | Holistic evaluation with Nielsen scoring and persona testing |
| Technical audit | `/audit` | A11y, performance, theming, responsive, anti-pattern checks |
| Design system alignment | `/normalize` | Realign drifted UI to design system standards |
| Production readiness | `/harden` | Edge cases, i18n, error handling, overflow |
| Final polish | `/polish` | Alignment, spacing, consistency, micro-detail fixes |

---

### Mode 4: Enhance — Satellite Operations

Transform existing interfaces with specialized operations.

**Find the right operation:**
```bash
python3 scripts/search.py "<what you want to do>" --operation
```

| Category | Operations | Use When |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **Visual impact** | `bolder`, `colorize`, `quieter` | Design too safe, too gray, or too loud |
| **Layout & type** | `arrange`, `typeset` | Spacing off, hierarchy unclear, fonts generic |
| **Motion & delight** | `animate`, `delight`, `overdrive` | UI feels static, needs personality or wow factor |
| **Content & UX** | `clarify`, `onboard` | Copy unclear, first-time experience missing |
| **Adaptation** | `adapt`, `optimize` | Not responsive, performance issues |
| **System** | `extract`, `normalize` | Need components, design system alignment |
| **Quality** | `audit`, `critique`, `harden`, `polish` | Pre-launch review, production hardening |

Each operation follows a consistent workflow:
1. Invoke `/frontend-design` context gathering protocol
2. Assess current state
3. Plan improvements
4. Implement changes
5. Verify quality

See [satellite-operations.md](reference/satellite-operations.md) for detailed workflows.

## Design Principles Quick Reference

Consult [design-principles.md](reference/design-principles.md) for full details.

### Typography
- Modular type scale with 5 sizes (xs, sm, base, lg, xl+)
- Fluid `clamp()` for headings, fixed `rem` for app UI body text
- Distinctive fonts — avoid Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Arial
- 16px minimum body text, `rem` units, never `px`

### Color
- OKLCH for perceptually uniform palettes
- Tint neutrals toward brand hue (chroma ~0.01)
- 60-30-10 rule: neutrals / secondary / accent
- WCAG: 4.5:1 body text, 3:1 large text and UI
- Never pure black (#000) or pure gray

### Layout
- 4pt base spacing system
- Visual rhythm: tight grouping for related, generous for sections
- Container queries for components, media queries for pages
- 44x44px minimum touch targets

### Motion
- Only animate `transform` and `opacity`
- 100-150ms instant feedback, 200-300ms state changes, 300-500ms layout changes
- ease-out-quart/quint/expo — never bounce or elastic
- Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

### Interaction
- 8 interactive states: default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, success
- `:focus-visible` not `:focus` — keyboard users only
- Undo > confirmation dialogs
- Placeholders are not labels

## AI Slop Detection

**CRITICAL**: Before delivering any interface, check for these AI-generated design tells:

| Tell | What To Look For |
|------|-----------------|
| AI color palette | Cyan-on-dark, purple-to-blue gradients, neon accents |
| Dark mode shortcut | Dark backgrounds with glowing accents instead of real design |
| Gradient text | Gradients applied to text/metrics for decorative impact |
| Glassmorphism | Blur effects and glass cards used decoratively everywhere |
| Card grid monotony | Identical cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly |
| Hero metric layout | Big number, small label, stats row, gradient accent |
| Rounded + shadow | Rounded rectangles with generic drop shadows |
| One-side border | Colored border on one side as lazy accent |
| Generic fonts | Inter, Roboto, system defaults with no personality |
| Bounce/elastic | Dated easing that draws attention to animation, not content |

**The test**: Show it to someone and say "AI made this." If they believe you immediately — fix it.

## Common Rules

These rules apply to ALL output from this skill:

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| No emojis as icons | Use SVG icons (Heroicons, Lucide, Simple Icons) |
| cursor-pointer | All clickable elements must have cursor:pointer |
| Hover transitions | 150-300ms with ease-out-quart/quint/expo |
| Contrast | 4.5:1 minimum for body text (WCAG AA) |
| Focus states | Visible for keyboard navigation (`:focus-visible`) |
| Reduced motion | Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` |
| Responsive | Test at 375px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px |
| Semantic HTML | Use `button`, `a`, `label`, `table` before ARIA |
| Touch targets | 44x44px minimum on all interactive elements |
| No layout animation | Only animate `transform` and `opacity` |
| Accessible forms | Every input needs a visible `<label>` |
| Images | Explicit `width`/`height` attributes to prevent CLS |

---
